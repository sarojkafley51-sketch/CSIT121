            <p>The journey of my first web page! Initially, I was so happy to learn about web pages; however, I felt that it was not as easy as I thought because I had to face a lot of confusion, and I suffered more because it took a long time to make it. When I started step by step, I got a little bit relaxed because it was progressing correctly. In the course of building this web page, I gained knowledge of how to structure HTML properly.</p>
