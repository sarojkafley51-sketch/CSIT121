        As an active learner, I was very excited to work on this HTML page. I have already learned what HTML is and how to structure it. On this page, I learned how to organize paragraphs, headings, lists in a clear and easily understandable way.

        During this Lab03 learning period, I have learned many new things about HTML and CSS. First and foremost, I learned how to use an external stylesheet to give structure and style to my HTML page in an organized way. To separate content from design and make the page easier to update, I learned how to link the style.css file in the &lt;head&gt; section. I used CSS to control spacing, heading styles, paragraphs, backgrounds, and text colors. I also created one ID selector for the header and footer and one class selector for the post card. After completing all of this, I validated both files using the W3C Validator to ensure there were no errors or warnings. Overall, through this module, I have learned more about semantic structure and making styles consistent, and I am confident that my HTML and CSS are accurate, readable, and meet professional standards.

        While I have started Lab05, first I have made my page responsive beginning through a single-column layout for a phone screen. We have to make a large screen, so I added a media query that helps to change many columns on a large screen. Next, I put simple navigation at the top and made sure that colors and spacing were easily readable. After doing this, I tested my layout by resizing my browser and using DevTools, which helped to check multiple devices.
