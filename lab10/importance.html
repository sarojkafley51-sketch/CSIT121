   <h2>Welcome to Importance Page of Geolocation API Page </h2>
        
    <h4>In this page of the website, I am talking about the importance of the Geolocation of API
        with some examples.
    </h4>

    <section id="overview">
        <!-- This part contains the text about the topic of Geolocation API-->
         <h4>Why is Geolocation API Important?</h4>
         <p>So far, we have already understood that the Geolocation API presents us with 
            accurate and useful kinds of information. In present days, a lot of our day to 
            day activities such as calling for ride, ordering food and checking weather are online 
            dependent. So the online service providers like restaurant, rideshare, weather etc. must 
            know the location of the user or the area preferred to them. If there were no Geolocation API
            user had to submit the address by themselves. It has made life very easier (MDN, 2025).<br><br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            In most of the cases like rideshare or food delivery one can easily type the address or enter
            the zip code to see weather. However in case of emergency, Geolocation API can easily
            detect the address so user can save significant time in doing so. Tourist and travelers may
            not necessarily know all the parts of the town they are travelling, they will be helped too.
            During the package tracking, mail person cannot update the location manually for all truck
            full of supplies so a location enabled device can update the package location 
            for thousands of costumer at the same time. <br><br>
        </p>
            This API is also important from safety point of view. Website must ask for the 
        permission to use location. They are also required to handle the personal information of
    the user in a very professional way. So in general, this API has made internet more reliable, safer and accessible to 
everyone based on their <p>location.</p>

    <h4>Some Examples</h4>
    <p>National Restaurant Association, in the Washington, D.C. area  says nearly 75% of 
        the order are made online. They are off-premise, which is 3 out of 4 order. 
        (National Restaurant Association, 2025) <br> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Lyft’s 2024 Safety Transparency Report says that 99.999 rides are safer. (Lyft Inc, 2024) <br>
        </p>
<p>
   W3C have also set sufficient guidelines to developer to adapt security 
   and privacy consideration (World Wide Web Consortium. 2022,)
