    <h2>Welcome to Uses of Geolocation API Page </h2>
        
    <h4>In this page of the website, I am talking about the use of the Geolocation of API
        with some examples.
    </h4>

    <section id="overview">
        <!-- This part contains the text about the topic of Geolocation API-->
         <h4>What are the major uses of Geolocation API?</h4>
         <p>One of the most use of the Geolocation API is on maps. Everyday We use 
            google map, apple maps and so many others. These live digital maps have made 
            navigation easier. They have made the travel shorter and safer. <br> <br>
        </p>

         <p>
            My other favorite use of the API is tracking the items. Once one places the online order,
            they are desperate to receive it. Sharing the live location of the items can help the recipient 
            to know when to expect the delivery. They can plan their day accordingly. This is other use of 
            the Geolocation API.
            <br><br>
           

         </p>
    

         <p>
            One of the major benefit of the Geolocation API that we hardly talk about is during the 
            Emergency. Bad weather alert, road detour, ambulance and police route can be easily 
            helped with this API. Moreover during rescue, accidents and also at remote location, this 
            comes to be helpful. 
         </p>

        <u>A one-shot position request: </u><br>

<em>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => { <br>
  const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords; <br>
  // Show a map centered at latitude / longitude.<br></em>
});<br><br>

<u>Watching a position for repeated updates:</u><br>

<em>const watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(position => {<br>
  const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;<br>
  // Show a map centered at latitude / longitude.<br>
});</em><br>
