            <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>
                    Hi, I am Saroj Kafle. I am going to 
                    <a href="https://www.ccbcmd.edu" target="_blank">Community 
                    College of Baltimore County</a> (popularly known as CCBC)
                    to pursue my Bachelors in Information technology. I am curious about web 
                    development. I can code in HTML and apply CSS to it. I use JavaScript to 
                    make my website interactive.<br><br>

                    I welcome you all in my personal page. This page is like my portfolio. I have shared you list of my
                    projects so far I have made in the semester.<br><br>
                    
                    During the course CSIT 121 I have learned a lot of things. I have made some mistakes, made some 
                    progress and learned a lot. I am thankful for guidance by my 
                    <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sQWmJBAPsQ" target="_blank">Professor Veronica Noone</a>.
                </p>

        <section id="overview">
            <h4>About This Website</h4><br>
                <p>
                    This page will serve as my personal portfolio and I will keep on updating this page 
                    with the progress I make ahead. 
                    In this website, I have total of 4 pages that includes the homepage and 
                    three (3) other pages. The other 3 pages are Goals, Pages and Learning. <br> <br>
                    In the 
                     <strong>home page,</strong> or this page, you can see a basic structure of the 
                     website that has a header, navigation bar, picture, text boxes and footer 
                    contents. These contents are common structure of the entire website. I have 
                    applied a common CSS to all 4 pages too. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the <strong>Goal</strong> page, I have shared my career goals. I have shared
                    what I want to learn and build over the time. There, I have tried drawing a CSS image
                    using a CSS commands that show my IT goals. 
                    In the same page, I have also shared 
                    a glimpse of my weekly learning so far. I have added a table to display the tools and 
                    and techniques that I learned in this semester<br><br>
                    In the <strong>Project</strong> page, I have tried sharing my coding skills 
                    so far. I have listed the tools I use so far,
                    techniques I am hoping to learn
                    and displayed a showcase of my projects. In a post card style thumbnail, I have shared 
                    the pages developed so far. You can scroll the page I made in that thumbnail. <br><br>
                    Finally, in the <strong>Learning</strong> page, I have added some of my reflection 
                    about my 
                    learning that I have learned so far with some of my opinion and thankfulness for the 
                    semester and to my Professor.
                    I have also mentioned a few links that I referred as well.
