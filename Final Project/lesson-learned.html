            <h4>Lessons I learned so far</h4>
                <p><em>This Semester was a journey to remember.</em></p>
                <!-- Overall, lesson I learned during the complection of this course-->
          <ul>
        <li>
        <p> After completing this project, I tested my final project in different browsers, for example, 
        Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and even on my cell phone. During the testing, 
        I saw that my website fit and worked well on a small screen also because I used media queries; 
        however, I noticed that the spacing did not look the same in all browsers. I figured out that 
        testing on multiple browsers helped me become familiar with the importance of responsive design.
        I also noticed that responsive design makes websites adjustable in every devices 
        and browsers.</p>
