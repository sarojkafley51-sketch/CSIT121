            <h4>Lessons I learned so far</h4>
                <p><em>This Semester was a journey to remember.</em></p>
                <!-- Overall, lesson I learned during the complection of this course-->
                 <!-- Reflection 1 — Course journey,growth & lesson learned -->
          <ul>
        <li>
       <p> When I started this course, I was very excited; however, I experienced ups and downs, and 
        now I have arrived at the final project. I feel really overwhelmed. I learned many things through
        my professor's feedback. First and foremost, I learned how to connect all the content and pages 
        together. Second, not only did this project teach me, but the other ten labs also taught me the 
        basic foundation of the website-building process. Similarly, final project taught me how to build
        a complete website by using different types of HTML structures, CSS for the overall website looks 
        such as color, font, spacing, and navigation, responsive design, and simple JavaScript for behavior. 
        In the beginning, I found it difficult to keep the design consistent in all pages, and managing all 
        the files properly was challenging because it took a long time to keep files in the correct place;
        however, after practicing and watching videos, enchnced my confident level as a webpage devloper.
         Finally, this project added more bricks toward becoming a good web page developer, a quick learner, a coder, and 
        a problem solver.</p>
        </li>

    <!--Reflection 2 — Browser & device testing-->

        <li>
        <p> After completing this project, I tested my final project in different browsers, for example, 
        Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and even on my cell phone. During the testing, 
        I saw that my website fit and worked well on a small screen also because I used media queries; 
        however, I noticed that the spacing did not look the same in all browsers. I figured out that 
        testing on multiple browsers helped me become familiar with the importance of responsive design.
        I also noticed that responsive design makes websites adjustable in every devices 
        and browsers.</p>
        </li>
        
        <!--Reflection 3 — Overall course lesson & final project.-->
        
        <li> 
        <p>This course encouraged me to think as a developer before writing code. It means I learned that
        I must have a plan and one decorative image before writing code. I feel that if I think about page
        layout, structure of pages, navigation, etc., before writing code, it saves my time and enhances my
        knowledge. I did the same things in this final project after reading the instructions, requirements,
        and rubric, which made it easier for me to properly organize all files and connect all pages correctly.
        As a result, it helped me develop an error-free and user-friendly website. Overall, I learned that it 
        is important to make a careful plan to build a professional website.</p>
