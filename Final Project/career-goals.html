                    My mission is to become a strong and responsible technology professional 
                    by continuously learning and improving my technical skills. I am 
                    committed to building a solid foundation in web development and related 
                    technologies so that I can create useful, efficient, and user-friendly 
                    solutions. Through consistent practice and hands-on projects, 
                    I aim to grow as a problem solver who can apply technology to 
                    real-world challenges.

                    My vision is to become a skilled and well-rounded technology professional
